# BioCLIP 2  [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/991449538.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15644363)

This repository contains the code for [BioCLIP 2](https://huggingface.co/imageomics/bioclip-2) training and evaluation (testing and visualizing embeddings). We developed this repository based on [BioCLIP](https://github.com/imageomics/BioCLIP) and [OpenCLIP](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip).
BioCLIP 2 is trained on the [TreeOfLife-200M dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/TreeOfLife-200M) and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both species classification and other biological visual tasks. The BioCLIP 2 website is hosted from the `gh-pages` branch of this repository.

---

BioCLIP 2 is a CLIP model trained on a new 200M-image dataset of biological organisms with fine-grained taxonomic labels.
BioCLIP 2 outperforms general domain baselines on a wide spread of biology-related tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification.

## Model

The main differences in the training implementation between BioCLIP 2 and BioCLIP are the adopted model architecture and the introduction of experience replay. BioCLIP 2 employs a ViT-L/14 CLIP architecture pre-trained with LAION-2B data. Along with the contrastive optimization of biological organism data, we also include part of the LAION-2B data for experience replay. In order to reduce the influence of the domain gap between hierarchical labels and image captions, we use two separate visual projectors on top of the visual encoder. This part of the code is in [transformer.py](src/open_clip/transformer.py).
We provide the weight of BioCLIP 2 in the [BioCLIP 2 model repo](https://huggingface.co/imageomics/bioclip-2).

## Commands

### Training
The [TreeOfLife-200M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/TreeOfLife-200M) images can be downloaded from their original sources with [distributed-downloader](https://github.com/Imageomics/distributed-downloader). [TreeOfLife-toolbox/docs](https://github.com/Imageomics/TreeOfLife-toolbox/tree/main/docs#treeoflife200m-dataset-download-guide) contains instructions for full download into the proper format, and the code to construct the webdataset for training. These repositories are included in the supplementary material.
[img2dataset](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) can be used to download data from the first three metadata parquet files of LAION-2B-en; we use the first downloaded 4,000 tar files for experience replay. Finally, download the validation set from [TreeOfLife-10M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/TreeOfLife-10M) ([download instructions](https://github.com/Imageomics/bioclip/blob/main/docs/imageomics/treeoflife10m.md)), as we use that for evaluation during training.

Clone this repository, then install the requirements:
```
conda env create -f requirements-training.yml
```

To train the model, run:
```
sbatch slurm/train.sh
```

### Evaluation
**Species classification**

We evaluated [BioCLIP 2](https://huggingface.co/imageomics/bioclip-2) on the same test sets as used for [BioCLIP](https://huggingface.co/imageomics/bioclip), as well as a newly curated camera trap test set:

- [NABirds](https://dl.allaboutbirds.org/nabirds): In place of [Birds525](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species), since it is no longer available.
- [Meta-Album](https://meta-album.github.io/): For comparison to [BioCLIP](https://huggingface.co/imageomics/bioclip), we used the Plankton, Insects, Insects 2, PlantNet, Fungi, PlantVillage, and Medicinal Leaf datasets.
- [Rare Species](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/rare-species): Nearly 12K images representing 400 species labeled Near Threatened through Extinct in the Wild by the [IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/).
- [IDLE-OO Camera Traps](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/IDLE-OO-Camera-Traps): A new dataset we curated to evaluate performance on camera trap images. It is constructed from five [Labeled Information Library of Alexandria: Biology and Conservation (LILA BC)](https://lila.science) datasets labeled to the image-level, which we then balanced. See the [IDLE-OO Camera Traps dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/IDLE-OO-Camera-Traps) for more details.

The metadata used in evaluation is provided in [`data/annotation`](data/annotation/), including [NABirds](data/annotation/nabirds), [Rare Species](data/annotation/rare_species/), and other benchmarks from [Meta Album](data/annotation/meta-album/). All evaluation parameters are described in [src/evaluation/README.md](src/evaluation/README.md).
Please be sure to update the directories accordingly to reflect the locations of these data and metadata in `slurm/eval.sh` and run:
```
sbatch slurm/eval.sh
```

**Other biological visual tasks**

We also evaluated on biological tasks that go beyond species classification with the following datasets:
- [NeWT](https://github.com/visipedia/newt)
- [FishNet](https://fishnet-2023.github.io/)
- [AwA2](https://cvml.ista.ac.at/AwA2/)
- [Herbarium19](https://www.kaggle.com/c/herbarium-2019-fgvc6/data)
- [PlantDoc](https://github.com/pratikkayal/PlantDoc-Dataset)

Please be sure to update the directories accordingly to reflect the locations of these data in `slurm/eval_other.sh` and run:
```
sbatch slurm/eval_other.sh
```
